### Pomodoro App

> A small project created with React.js

### About

Pomodoro is a technique that uses a stopwatch to divide tasks into 25-minute periods, separated by brief intervals. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can increase mental alertness. In this app, in addition to the timer, you can add activities you want to focus on.
